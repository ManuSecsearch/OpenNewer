# How to create a plugin

- Once you get the binary compiled successfully, you'll have to place a copy of it into the bin destination folder in the osx path. The osx path is under this folder [osx](./et_fileconvert/bin/osx)

- Then you'll have to compress the folder [et_fileconvert](./et_fileconvert) and the file [et_fileconvert.rb](./et_fileconvert.rb) all together in one zip file

- Finally you have to rename the .zip file into a .rbz file 


# Your compressed file

The archive should contains the following : 

```
et_fileconvert.rb
et_fileconvert\ruby\main.rb
et_fileconvert\bin\osx\OpenNewer
et_fileconvert\logs
```

Enjoy
